/*
 * Issue #75 :: Anchor tag attribute target="{my value}" seems to be ignored
 * as at 9-May-2018
 * 
 * Spec :: We should should add in router.js -> $.addDelegtedListener(function()) 
 * a check to the if clause:
 *
 *    if 
 *      a target is given AND the target is not "_self", 
 *    then
 *      navigate shouldn't be called AND default should not be prevented
 *
 **/

Behaviors
1. When <a> has target !== '_self', typical link action occurs opening new window/tab.
2. When <a> has target === '_self' or NO target attr, layerjs handles link processing.
