Mohenjo Daro is a movie that tries to recreate the ancient Indus Valley civilization, which flourished around 2500 BCE. The movie shows the culture, architecture, religion, and politics of the city, as well as its downfall due to natural disasters and human greed. The movie also features a love story between Sarman (Hrithik Roshan), a farmer from a nearby village, and Chaani (Pooja Hegde), the daughter of the chief priest and the chosen one of the river goddess.
 
The movie has been criticized for its historical inaccuracies, poor CGI effects, weak script, and clichÃ©d plot. Many viewers have pointed out the errors in the depiction of Mohenjo Daro, such as the use of horses, iron weapons, and coins, which were not present in that period. The movie also fails to capture the diversity and complexity of the Indus Valley civilization, which had a sophisticated urban planning, writing system, trade network, and social structure. The movie relies on stereotypes and tropes of Bollywood movies, such as songs, dances, fights, and melodrama.
 
However, some critics have praised the movie for its ambition, vision, and scale. The movie is one of the most expensive Bollywood movies ever made, with a budget of around $30 million. The movie also showcases the talent and charisma of Hrithik Roshan, who carries the movie with his performance and physique. The movie also has some impressive sets, costumes, and action sequences that create a sense of spectacle and adventure.
 
Mohenjo Daro is a movie that may appeal to fans of Hrithik Roshan or historical epics. However, it is not a movie that does justice to the rich and fascinating history of the Indus Valley civilization. It is a movie that could have been much better with more research, creativity, and originality.
